I am extremely happy to have been a part of the successful launch of One Home Denverâ€™s website. Basically they help people who are in need of shelter navigate their way through a large and complicated system that wants to help and has resources for them but can seem overly complicated and overwhelming to someone not familiar with the system and how it works across multiple organizations each with different focuses.

My contribution to the project was mostly production development, as they already had designs and needed to make it come to life for the launch!
